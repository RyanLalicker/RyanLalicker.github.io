## Slide with Plot

```{r pressure}
library(ggplot2)

penguinsR <- readr::read_csv('penguins.csv', show_col_types = FALSE)

ggplot(data = penguinsR, aes(x = year, y = bill_length_mm, color = species)) + geom_line() + scale_color_manual(values = c("Adelie" = "red", "Chinstrap" = "maroon", "Gentoo" = "yellow")) + theme(panel.background = element_rect("darkgreen")) + labs(title = "Penguine bill length by year", x = "Year", y = "Length of bill (mm)")

```
